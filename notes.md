particularly on its implementation within higher education.

Purpose of peer-observation and problems:

* "There is, however, some confusion or uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability, and consequently over the role of the observer."
* Making it about accountability can lead to disengagement. "There is, however, some confusion or uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability, and consequently over the role of the observer."
* Leads to a passive approach and often defensive behaviour from critique. "First, there seems to be no real evidence that people develop and improve through the judgements or comments of others."
* Emphasis ends up being development by others, not self-development.
* Judging colleagues can undermine team building.

Observation still has benefits:

* Demands little resources
* Prevents teachers from becoming isolated (which I often feel at University)

Proposes a reflective approach:

* Observe others for self-development. "We are observing in order to reflect upon our own teaching and for active self-development"
* "the rationale of the observation here being to make us aware of different approaches, to encourage an open-mind and questioning attitude, and to provide an environment in which we can reassess our own teaching in the light of the teaching of others"

Implementation:

* Must be formalized: "It is essential that the procedure should be formalized
  in some way to ensure that it does not die through inertia and the pressures
  of workload."
* People can still feel judged. "The participants should, therefore, be
  reassured and consulted, and decide jointly on such factors as who should be
  observed, how often, what protocol should be followed, what the focus should
  be, and what form feedback should take"
* Feedback is key. "in order for insights to be clarified and for good practice
  to be shared and disseminated."
* Format: Seminars, workshops, discussions, forms. "as along as the emphasis is
  always on **what the observer has learnt** or decided to think about."

Sample observation form asks:

* Lessons learned from observing
* Further action planned by observer
* Topics that may be of broader interest

Ideas:

* **This is very different from PGCAP and SoES implementations**
* **Could the PGCAP patch be restructured to this format with us observing more experience teachers?**

Studied implementation of PO in an R1 university department.

Good review of PO methods, advantages, and disadvantages.

Looked into 3 models of PO:

* Evaluation: Admin or other senior staff observes to monitor teaching quality and pass judgement.
* Developmental: Educational expert observes and focuses on reflection of what makes good teaching.
* Collaborative: More collegial where peers observe and focus on formative feedback to improve teaching.

Implemented collaborative model and renamed to 'Peer Partnerships in Teaching'
noting that "rebranding/renaming resulted from committee discussions and was a
strategy to gain additional favor and interest from our departmental faculty".
Goes on to say that **"I can confirm that any model that is collaborative in
nature will have a greater chance of ongoing success"**.

Notes some negative perception of the process:

> The common perceptions encountered, and which required consultation,
> included:
> 1. Effective peer review is too time consuming and involves knowledge and
>    skills we as a faculty do not have.
> 2. Personal or professional rivalries will contaminate the process and create
>    deep divisions or recourse to legal remedies
> 3. Peer review violates the norms of privacy and egalitarianism in teaching

Some suggestions on how to combat this include:

> * Voluntary participation – For both roles, faculty members who are coerced
>   into the process feedback are much less likely to follow advice and/or seek
>   feedback out of their own interest to improve their teaching abilities.
> * Confidentiality – Research indicates that for col- leagues to trust each
>   other to ask candid questions, or reveal teaching dilemmas, and then each
>   pair must know that the other will not share their conversations to
>   compromise tenure, promotion, or in the case of faculty tenured, compromise
>   the respect they have earned as a teacher (Brinko 1993; Carroll and
>   Goldberg 1989; Hicks 1999).

**That last one in particular is noteworthy to me.** Not sure if this is
implemented in our own practices. It's also an argument for the **reflective
approach** of Cosh.

Study of a single participant going through a few different processes.

1. Peer-observed (collaborative model)
1. Observed by an expert educator (developmental)

Main finding was that the feedback quality and amount of reflective practice
by the participant improved after doing the exercise with the educator.

* They learned how to do reflective practice and critical feedback from the
  expert.
* Purely peer-observation leads to mostly positive feedback with little
  critique and reflection.
* Reflective practice is difficult and won't be done properly if not taught
  (and apparently shown).

Proposes a hybrid approach, with some expert educator involvement to model good
reflective practice and critical feedback and peer observations to scale and
provide domain knowledge.

Interesting references there:

* "there remain doubts about the extent to which participation in formative
  teaching observation can contribute to the development of critical reflection
  and legitimate enhancement of practice ([Hatzipanagos and Lygo-Baker, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1080/03098770600965425))"
* "many staff are ill-equipped, without further training, to evaluate and
  provide feedback on the effectiveness of others’ teaching" (Gosling, 2009)"
* "One solution is to use a hybrid teaching observation model that combines
  feed- back from both an expert observer and disciplinary peer observer, but
  whilst this may provide a mechanism for developing a culture of reflection on
  teaching ([Atkinson and Bolt, 2010](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/josotl/article/view/1798/1795))"
* Three domains of purpose of PO [Hammersley-Fletcher and Orsmond (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1080/0307507042000236380): of
  ‘accountability’, ‘personal reflection’ and ‘dissemination of best practice’.
* "this series of observations appeared to identify more of the weaknesses (cf.
  [Hammersley-Fletcher and Orsmond 2004; 2005](https://doi.org/10.1080/03075070500043358)). There was an almost complete
  lack of critical reflection and an exclusive focus on positive reflection,
  producing little or no opportunity to change or develop teaching practice as
  a result of the exercise."
* "It has been widely suggested that peers are often motivated to say only good
  things about their colleagues and tend to avoid even constructive criticism
  ([Shortland 2010](https://doi.org/10.1080/14703297.2010.498181)). The present data are certainly in line with this."
* "The developmental observation was therefore the most effective by far in
  achieving the goal of providing feedback to prompt self-regulative and
  reflective practice."
* "Thus reflective practice in teaching appears to be a skill that needs to be
  taught to its would-be practitioners ([Aronson 2010](https://doi.org/10.3109/0142159X.2010.507714))"
* "three of the peer review observations identified confusion over the purpose
  of observation and lack of awareness of the meaning or importance of
  reflective practice. This confusion was effectively dissipated following the
  lecturer’s participation in the same exercise using a developmental model"
* "If the goal of teaching observation is to prompt and enhance reflective
  practice, this suggests an important role for developmental observers in
  facilitating this, supporting the conclusions of
  [Lygo-Baker and Hatzipanagos (2007)](https://web.p.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=14479494&AN=28652157&h=Wm%2fPT7%2fjeWySJaRCZQwgAeexzwV6pgypJKFDDd3OFE1ZnkS8%2fBriaY9dy42y8uPREdGTiBSR6XsXhyYx1xJYHw%3d%3d&crl=c&resultNs=AdminWebAuth&resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d14479494%26AN%3d28652157)".

**Apparently, all of this only works with an accompanying good quality training
on reflective practice.** While we practice this in PGCAP, we were never shown
examples of good practice.
