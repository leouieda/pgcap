# Reflection

Through the {term}`PGCAP` programme, I have been able to supplement my existing
skill set in order to fulfil the characteristics outlined in [Descriptor 2](d2)
of the {term}`UKPSF`:

**Successful engagement across all five Areas of Activity:**
I have designed a new module in the Geophysics programme, made significant
changes to existing modules, and engaged in the creation of a new degree
programme (A1).
I have taught modules, field classes, tutorials, and served as academic advisor
to students (A2-3).
The student evaluations of my modules, even during the shift to online
learning, were overwhelmingly positive (A4).
I am in the process of completing the PGCAP and have volunteered to take part
in the School of Environmental Sciences' peer-observation programme (A5).

**Appropriate knowledge and understanding across all aspects of Core Knowledge:**
I am an expert in my field and my peers routinely make use of my open-access
teaching resources for their own classes (K1-2).
I am in the process of completing the PGCAP and have undergone pedagogic training
with other domain-focused organizations (K2-5).
I have demonstrable experience with the production of multimedia content,
interactive computational tools, websites, VLEs, video conferencing, and more
in the context of teaching in-person and remotely (K4).
My [report on peer-observation](report) demonstrates my understanding of the
implications of quality assurance and enhancement (K6).

**A commitment to all the Professional Values:**
My teaching makes use of different modes of delivery, always includes the option
of participating asynchronously without penalty, and I engage with teaching
outside of the traditional classroom setting (e.g., YouTube live streams) (V1).
I often give online tutorials, talks, and discussion sessions to student groups,
all of which are recorded and openly available (V2).
I constantly refine my teaching based on knowledge gained from training (PGCAP
and others) and from consultations with my peers in a worldwide setting (V3).
I routinely discuss with my UK-based peers and adapt my teaching to the current
job market demands and student interests (V4).

**Successful engagement in appropriate teaching practices related to the Areas
of Activity:**
I have participated in all aspects of education at the University, including
teaching, assessment, moderation, curriculum design, student support, and CPD.

**Successful incorporation of subject and pedagogic research and/ or
scholarship within the above activities, as part of an integrated approach to
academic practice:**
My teaching involves diverse delivery methods, a range of summative and
formative {term}`authentic assessment`, and on-going topics of domain research.
My teaching methods are routinely refined based on current domain-specific and
general pedagogic literature.
Not only does my research inform my teaching, but also my current teaching
(outside of my main expertise) is informing my research.

**Successful engagement in continuing professional development in relation to
teaching, learning, assessment and, where appropriate, related professional
practices:**
I have undergone the PGCAP program, have volunteered for the School of
Environmental Sciences' peer-observation program, seek out training from
external domain-specific sources, and continue to experiment with new methods
for engaging students.
