# Notes

These are some of my notes on the literature around peer-observation,
particularly on its implementation within higher education.

Purpose of peer-observation and problems:

* "There is, however, some confusion or uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability, and consequently over the role of the observer."
* Making it about accountability can lead to disengagement. "There is, however, some confusion or uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability, and consequently over the role of the observer."
* Leads to a passive approach and often defensive behaviour from critique. "First, there seems to be no real evidence that people develop and improve through the judgements or comments of others."
* Emphasis ends up being development by others, not self-development.
* Judging colleagues can undermine team building.

Observation still has benefits:

* Demands little resources
* Prevents teachers from becoming isolated (which I often feel at University)

Proposes a reflective approach:

* Observe others for self-development. "We are observing in order to reflect upon our own teaching and for active self-development"
* "the rationale of the observation here being to make us aware of different approaches, to encourage an open-mind and questioning attitude, and to provide an environment in which we can reassess our own teaching in the light of the teaching of others"

Implementation:

* Must be formalized: "It is essential that the procedure should be formalized
  in some way to ensure that it does not die through inertia and the pressures
  of workload."
* People can still feel judged. "The participants should, therefore, be
  reassured and consulted, and decide jointly on such factors as who should be
  observed, how often, what protocol should be followed, what the focus should
  be, and what form feedback should take"
* Feedback is key. "in order for insights to be clarified and for good practice
  to be shared and disseminated."
* Format: Seminars, workshops, discussions, forms. "as along as the emphasis is
  always on **what the observer has learnt** or decided to think about."

Sample observation form asks:

* Lessons learned from observing
* Further action planned by observer
* Topics that may be of broader interest

Ideas:

* **This is very different from PGCAP and SoES implementations**
* **Could the PGCAP patch be restructured to this format with us observing more experience teachers?**

Studied implementation of PO in an R1 university department.

Good review of PO methods, advantages, and disadvantages.

Looked into 3 models of PO:

* Evaluation: Admin or other senior staff observes to monitor teaching quality and pass judgement.
* Developmental: Educational expert observes and focuses on reflection of what makes good teaching.
* Collaborative: More collegial where peers observe and focus on formative feedback to improve teaching.

Implemented collaborative model and renamed to 'Peer Partnerships in Teaching'
noting that "rebranding/renaming resulted from committee discussions and was a
strategy to gain additional favor and interest from our departmental faculty".
Goes on to say that **"I can confirm that any model that is collaborative in
nature will have a greater chance of ongoing success"**.

Notes some negative perception of the process:

> The common perceptions encountered, and which required consultation,
> included:
> 1. Effective peer review is too time consuming and involves knowledge and
>    skills we as a faculty do not have.
> 2. Personal or professional rivalries will contaminate the process and create
>    deep divisions or recourse to legal remedies
> 3. Peer review violates the norms of privacy and egalitarianism in teaching

Some suggestions on how to combat this include:

> * Voluntary participation – For both roles, faculty members who are coerced
>   into the process feedback are much less likely to follow advice and/or seek
>   feedback out of their own interest to improve their teaching abilities.
> * Confidentiality – Research indicates that for col- leagues to trust each
>   other to ask candid questions, or reveal teaching dilemmas, and then each
>   pair must know that the other will not share their conversations to
>   compromise tenure, promotion, or in the case of faculty tenured, compromise
>   the respect they have earned as a teacher (Brinko 1993; Carroll and
>   Goldberg 1989; Hicks 1999).

**That last one in particular is noteworthy to me.** Not sure if this is
implemented in our own practices. It's also an argument for the **reflective
approach** of Cosh.
