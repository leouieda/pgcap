# Notes

These are some of my notes on the literature around peer-observation,
particularly on its implementation within higher education.

## Peer Observation in Higher Education ‐ A Reflective Approach

> Cosh, J. (1998, May). Peer Observation in Higher Education ‐‐ A Reflective Approach. Innovations in Education &amp; Training International. Informa UK Limited. https://doi.org/10.1080/1355800980350211

Purpose of peer-observation and problems:

* "There is, however, some confusion or uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability, and consequently over the role of the observer."
* Making it about accountability can lead to disengagement. "There is, however, some confusion or uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability, and consequently over the role of the observer."
* Leads to a passive approach and often defensive behaviour from critique. "First, there seems to be no real evidence that people develop and improve through the judgements or comments of others."
* Emphasis ends up being development by others, not self-development.
* Judging colleagues can undermine team building.

Observation still has benefits:

* Demands little resources
* Prevents teachers from becoming isolated (which I often feel at University)

Proposes a reflective approach:

* Observe others for self-development. "We are observing in order to reflect upon our own teaching and for active self-development"
* "the rationale of the observation here being to make us aware of different approaches, to encourage an open-mind and questioning attitude, and to provide an environment in which we can reassess our own teaching in the light of the teaching of others"

Implementation:

* Must be formalized: "It is essential that the procedure should be formalized
  in some way to ensure that it does not die through inertia and the pressures
  of workload."
* People can still feel judged. "The participants should, therefore, be
  reassured and consulted, and decide jointly on such factors as who should be
  observed, how often, what protocol should be followed, what the focus should
  be, and what form feedback should take"
* Feedback is key. "in order for insights to be clarified and for good practice
  to be shared and disseminated."
* Format: Seminars, workshops, discussions, forms. "as along as the emphasis is
  always on **what the observer has learnt** or decided to think about."

Sample observation form asks:

* Lessons learned from observing
* Further action planned by observer
* Topics that may be of broader interest

Ideas:

* **This is very different from PGCAP and SoES implementations**
* **Could the PGCAP patch be restructured to this format with us observing more experience teachers?**
