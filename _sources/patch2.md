## Script

One of the most important things I gained from my Bachelor's degree was
learning how to teach myself.

Through it, I gained self-reliance and specialization beyond what my program
could offer.

But learning independently is a difficult skill to master, even more so without
proper guidance.

It is made even harder by a lack of confidence in one's own ability and a
passive view of education, which are often deeply ingrained in students minds.

My teaching philosophy is centered around providing the resources that students
require to build up their confidence, master key skills, and grow in
independence.

A significant part of my efforts go into maintaining a positive and stimulating
learning environment,
which has a significant impact on students' motivation to learn.

My goal is to empower students by giving them agency over their learning.

For example, I offer a variety of recorded, written, and practical material so
that students are able to go over it at their own pace, either independently or
with guided instruction during a live session.

I provide extra challenges and necessary scaffolding to account for variations
in students prior knowledge
{cite}`paas2003cognitiveload` {cite}`kalyuga2007expertisereversal`.

As much as possible, I try to allow students to choose the topic of their
assessments.

I develop my lessons around coding and analysis of real data to provide
students with authentic tasks and a chance to practice a wide range of skills.

I build in time for peer-instruction to encourage students to interact and
learn from each other {cite}`vickrey2015peerinstruction`.

This is doubly important for online learning, where engagement and social
isolation are often problematic.

A sense of agency, learning skills that are demonstrably useful, and learning
along side their peers are some of the biggest motivators for adult learners
{cite}`wlodkowski2017enhancing`.



I'm also a proponent of open-access and collective development of
learning resources.

Too often we find ourselves developing the same set of slides, practicals,
and notes.

When open-access resources do exist, they tend to be highly specific to
particular modules, lessening their potential for reuse.

There is often also no easy way for others to submit improvements to the
material.

In this, higher education has much to learn from the open-source software
community.

In open-source, we work collaboratively to develop software that fulfils the
needs of the community.

We encourage others to contribute changes and join our development teams
instead reinventing the wheel.

We develop tools like version control systems that enable collaboration on our
projects.

Ultimately, I plan to update and rework my current teaching materials to make
them more suitable for collaborative development.

I hope to implement several of the research-based techniques outlined in
Devenyi et al. (2018)
{cite}`devenyi2018colablesson`.

This will be a significant effort but I strongly believe that it is well worth
doing.

We all benefit from improving the commons.
