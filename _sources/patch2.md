# Patch 2: Digital Storytelling (My Teaching Philosophy)

> This is a video about my teaching philosophy, how I view my role in higher
> education, my principles and goals for students.

Think about who I am:

* Current job
* Previous jobs
* Qualifications
* Research

Self-reflection on values and beliefs. Very personal.
Provide examples of what I do.
Incorporates my vision as educator.
Put references.
Goals for future development.

Think about my own learner experience
Best experience as a teacher
Why do I teach? Why does it matter.
What am I trying to achieve with my teaching
Method and strategies. Why do I do them? Is it for students or myself?
Cite papers.
How important is feedback?
How do I collect it?
What have I learned from peer feedback?

Use first person
Be specific with examples
Link to subject
What is student/teacher relationship
Goals for my students?

3-5 minutes.
Aim for 500-600 words (assuming 100 words/min).

One of the most important things I gained from my Bachelor's degree was
learning how to teach myself.

Through it, I gained self-reliance and specialization beyond what my program
could offer.

But learning independently is a difficult skill to master, even more so without
proper guidance.

It is made even harder by a lack of confidence in one's own ability and a
passive view of education, which are often deeply ingrained in students minds.

My teaching philosophy is centered around providing the resources that students
require to build up their confidence, master key skills, and grow in
independence.

A significant part of my efforts go into maintaining a positive and stimulating
learning environment.

The learning environment can have a significant impact on students' motivation
to learn.

I aim to empower students by giving them agency over their learning.

Students have the opportunity to go over material at their own pace,
either independently or with guided instruction.

I provide extra challenges and necessary scaffolding to account for variations
in students prior knowledge
{cite}`paas2003cognitiveload` {cite}`kalyuga2007expertisereversal`.

As much as possible, I try to allow students to choose the topic of their
assessments.

I develop my lessons around coding and analysis of real data to provide
students with authentic tasks and a chance to practice a wide range of skills.

I build in time for peer-instruction to encourage students to interact and
learn from each other {cite}`vickrey2015peerinstruction`.

This is doubly important for online learning, where engagement and social
isolation are often problematic.

A sense of agency, learning skills that are demonstrably useful, and learning
along side their peers are some of the biggest motivators for adult learners
{cite}`wlodkowski2017enhancing`.



I'm also a proponent of open-access and collective development of
learning resources.

Too often we find ourselves developing the same set of slides, practicals,
and notes.

When open-access resources do exist, they tend to be highly specific to
particular modules, lessening their potential for reuse.

There if often no easy way for others to submit improvements to the material.

This is a field where higher education can learn a lot from the open-source
software community.

In open-source, we work collaboratively to develop software that fulfils the
needs of the community.

We encourage others to contribute changes and join our development teams
instead reinventing the wheel.

We develop tools like version control systems that enable collaboration.

Ultimately, I plan to update and rework my current teaching materials to make
them more suitable for collaborative development.

I hope to implement several of the research-based techniques outlined in
{cite}`devenyi2018colablesson`.

This will be a significant effort but I strongly believe that it is well worth
doing.

We all benefit from improving the commons.
