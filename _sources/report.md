* When done right, peer-observation of teaching can be a valuable tool to
  promote **discussion and collegiality** as well as **disseminated good
  pedagogic practices**.
* There seems to be consensus in the literature that peer-observation should
  **not be used for evaluation** of staff (e.g., for promotion, probation,
  tenure).
* **Blended models** of peer-observation seem to work best.
* Care must be taken to ensure that the process does not become stale,
  repetitive, or seen as a chore and time-sink.
* Focusing on the **self-development of the observer** (as opposed to the
  judgement of the observed) can be a tool for dispelling feelings of anxiety
  and hesitation towards the practice.

## Introduction

**Peer-observation of teaching** is a practice in which one or more staff
observe the teaching of another and provide feedback for reflection and
discussion. The practice of peer-observation can vary both in format and in
overall goals {cite:p}`Cosh1998`.
However, it is still widely used as a form of
professional development for teaching staff both within and, more recently,
across different higher education institutions {cite:p}`OKeeffe2021`.

There are a large number of studies looking into different models of
peer-observation, the effectiveness of their implementation strategies in
various contexts, and the challenges faced during implementation
(see {cite:t}`Fletcher2018` for an overview).
While enlightening, this abundance can make it challenging for individuals who
desire to adopt peer-observation within their institutions to figure out which
model to use and how to best conduct the practice.

This review is my attempt to synthesise some of the best practices found in the
teaching and learning literature around peer-observation in a higher education
setting.
I will offer an overview of the most common models, the evidence in favour or
against them, and the key recommendations distilled from them.
My hope is that this investigation will inform the current practice of
peer-observation within the {term}`PGCAP` program and the recent adoption
within the School of Environmental Sciences of the University of Liverpool, UK.


## The purposes of peer observation

The purpose of the peer-observation exercise is subjective and there doesn't
appear to be a consensus in the literature.
As pointed out by {cite:t}`Cosh1998`, "There is, however, some confusion or
uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability,
and consequently over the role of the observer."
Nonetheless, {cite:t}`HammersleyFletcher2004` identified three broadly defined
purposes of peer-observation among practitioners:

:::{glossary}
Accountability
    Evaluation of the teacher.

Personal reflection
    Observation elicits reflection on the pedagogical practices by both
    observer and observed.

Dissemination of best practice
    Observers learn and share best-practices observed with peers.
:::

The emphasis placed on each of these different purposes varies with the
particular model of peer-observation being used.
There is also debate on whether reflection is done effectively in practice, or
is even achieved at all, depending on circumstances
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2005`.

The one thing that is recurrent in the literature is that a peer-observation
should **not** be done solely for {term}`accountability` purposes
{cite:p}`Cosh1998,Fletcher2018,HammersleyFletcher2004,HammersleyFletcher2005`.
Doing so undermines team building, leads to disengagement of staff, and can
prompt defensive behaviour towards critique.


## Models of peer observation

Most recent studies tend to focus on one of three models of peer-observation
{cite:p}`Gosling2002`:
{term}`evaluation`, {term}`developmental`, and {term}`collaborative`.
However, {cite:t}`Cosh1998` proposed the {term}`reflective` model as an
alternative which has characteristics often reflecting the conclusions of
studies into the other three models, even when not named specifically (e.g.,
{cite:t}`HammersleyFletcher2004,Yiend2012,Fletcher2018`).

:::{glossary}
Evaluation
    Administrative or other senior staff observe with the goal to monitor
    teaching quality and pass judgement on the teaching of the observed
    (i.e., purely for {term}`accountability`).

Developmental
    An educational expert is the observer and focuses on providing critical
    feedback on the teaching practice instead of the module content directly.
    The expert also facilitates reflective practice of the observed and serves
    as a model for effective feedback.

Collaborative
    A peer (teaching staff) serves as the observer. Generally regarded as more
    collegial where peers observe and focus on formative feedback to improve
    teaching. Peers can be from within or without the subject matter being
    taught.

Reflective
    Like the collaborative model, a peer serves as the observer. However, the
    focus is shifted from the observed to the observer, who is instead
    performing a reflective analysis of their own teaching in light of the
    observation.
:::

The evidence seems to be in favour of using a combination of the
{term}`developmental` and {term}`collaborative` models (e.g.
{cite:t}`Atkinson2010` and {cite:t}`Yiend2012`).
Some of the reasons **against a solely peer-to-peer observation** include:

* "Many staff are ill-equipped, without further training, to evaluate and
  provide feedback on the effectiveness of othersâ€™ teaching" -- {cite:p}`Gosling2009`.
* Reflective practice is difficult and is a skill that needs to be taught and
  demonstrated in order to be used effectively {cite:p}`Aronson2010`.
* Peers are often reluctant to provide even constructive criticism and tend to
  focus solely on the good aspects of a colleague's teaching
  {cite:p}`Shortland2010`. This is likely exacerbated by power imbalance
  between the observer and observed and office politics.

In these instances, a first observation is performed by an educational expert
and then followed by a peer-observation.
{cite:t}`Yiend2012` found that the amount of critical feedback and reflective
practice of the observed increased when they were first exposed to an expert
educator.
{cite:t}`Lygo-Baker2007` also concludes that the participation of a
developmental observer is important for facilitating reflective practice.
Furthermore, an expert educator can help provide the necessary scaffolding for
academic staff to discuss pedagogical practice {cite:p}`Thomson2015`.


## Challenges

Implementation of a blended developmental-collaborative model are not without
challenges, not least of which is the negative perception of the practice from
staff:

:::{epigraph}
The common perceptions encountered, and which required consultation, included:

1. Effective peer review is too time consuming and involves knowledge and
   skills we as a faculty do not have.
1. Personal or professional rivalries will contaminate the process and create
   deep divisions or recourse to legal remedies.
1. Peer review violates the norms of privacy and egalitarianism in teaching.

-- {cite:t}`Fletcher2018`
:::

Possible solutions to combat these negative perceptions include:

* Allowing staff to opt-in to both observing and being observed
  {cite:p}`Fletcher2018`. This can help lower tensions between teaching staff
  and administration.
* Reports must be confidential between the observer and observed. Peers will
  only discuss difficult issues when they know that the conversations will not
  be shared, and thus negatively impact their career progression
  {cite:p}`Hicks1999,Brinko1993`.

Additionally, it would be useful to highlight the many benefits of observation
for the **observer** that have been reported:

* A {term}`collaborative` approach contributes to the cohesion of the
  institution and provides a starting point for cross-disciplinary discussion
  {cite:p}`Whipp2017`.
* Observers are better able to reflect on their own practice
  {cite:p}`Sullivan2012`.
* Learning new strategies and styles which can be adopted in their teaching
  {cite:p}`Hendry2012`.
* When peers are from the same discipline, discern differences in the content
  delivered by the observed and their own {cite:p}`Tenenberg2014`.

:::{admonition} Proposal
:class: tip

To me, all of these are strong arguments in favour of a **different blended
model**:

1. First a {term}`developmental` observation with the purpose of modelling good
   reflective practice and feedback.
1. Followed by a {term}`reflective` observation with the previous observed now
   serving as observer and focusing on their self-development from the
   observation.
:::

## Practical implementation

Most studies that I have found use slight variations of the following
implementation
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`:

1. Peers are identified and paired for observation (sometimes trios are used).
1. A pre-observation meeting is help where the peers establish particular areas
   of focus, expectations, and logistics.
1. A post-observation meeting is help where the observers provide feedback and
   the observed reflects on the feedback. Areas for improvement, concerns, and
   examples of good practice are usually identified as well.

{cite:t}`Cosh1998` identified the following principles for successful practice
of peer-observation:

* **Minimal workload:** "the procedure should be formalized in some way to
  ensure that it does not die through inertia and the pressures of workload" --
  {cite:t}`Cosh1998`
* **Agency:** Participants should be given agency over who should be observed,
  methods, focus, etc.
* **Feedback is key:** Proper feedback must be provided after the observation
  through **short** forms with as little structure and box-ticking as possible.

It is also important that the process is dynamic and observations are rotated
frequently to avoid the process becoming repetitive
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`.

Under my proposed blended {term}`developmental`-{term}`reflective` model:

* The first developmental observation would serve as training in critical
  feedback and reflective practice for the observed, with good practice
  modelled by the expert educator.
* The developmental component needs not happen with as much frequency as the
  peer-to-peer reflective component. Perhaps only once every few academic years.
* The feedback form would follow the suggestion of {cite:t}`Cosh1998` and
  include: lessons learned from observing, further action planned for the
  observer, topics that may be of broader interest. The feedback form is
  **confidential** and only the examples of good-practice are shared more
  widely.
* Peers are self-assigned with facilitation from the parties running the
  exercise.
* Peer-to-peer observation should be done both within the same discipline and
  across disciplines. There is evidence that "disciplinary focus [...]
  sometimes hinders deep reflection about teaching practices"
  {cite:p}`Torres2017`. Having some cross-disciplinary pairings can help shift
  the focus away from the content and towards the pedagogy and student learning
  {cite:p}`OKeeffe2021`.

This {term}`developmental`-{term}`reflective` blended approach can be
particularly useful when less experience staff are assigned as observers of
more experienced educators who have undergone the peer-observation process in
the past {cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`.


## Peer-observation at the University of Liverpool

The following section is a reflection on how the implementations of
peer-observation within the School of Environmental Sciences and the
{term}`PGCAP` program relate to the content laid out above.

### School of Environmental Sciences

As of 2022, the School of Environmental Sciences started the establishment of a
peer-observation program with the goal of improving pedagogy and disseminating
examples of good practice across the many disciplines covered by the School.
The program is based on the {term}`collaborative` model, with academic staff
serving as both observers and observed.
The feedback form is focused on highlighting good practice of the observed and
pin-pointing any issues that may have arisen.

The training that is offered to staff involves relay of information about the
process, what to observe, how to conduct the pre- and post-observation
discussions, etc.
However, there is no hands-on practice or demonstration of how to conduct
the observation and reflective practice effectively by an expert.

### PGCAP

The first module of the PGCAP (ADEV700 in my case), includes two
peer-observation exercises as summative assessments
(see [my reflections on these observations](observations)).
Both are carried out in a mix of the  {term}`evaluation` and
{term}`collaborative` model, with the observer being an academic peer but
simultaneously having a large focus on the evaluation of the quality of
teaching as well as areas of improvement and examples of good practice.
Staff participating in the module as students are only observed and do not
carry out observations themselves (though the option of being an observer for
another student was given).

The training received during the module relays information about the format,
how to conduct reflective practice, and details of how to carry out the pre-
and post-observation discussions.
Like the School of Environmental Sciences, there is also no hands-on training
or demonstration of good practice by an expert observer.

## Recommendations

In light of the literature review carried out above, I would like to make
recommendations for those implementing peer-observation:

:::{admonition} General
:class: note

* **Do not use for peer-observation for evaluation** of staff (e.g., for
  promotion, probation, tenure). There seems to be consensus in the literature
  about this point.
* **Blended models** of peer-observation seem to work best. It is common for the
  {term}`developmental` and {term}`collaborative` models to be combined. I would
  argue in favour of using the {term}`reflective` model instead of the {term}`collaborative`.
* Focus on the **self-development of the observer** (as opposed to the
  judgement of the observed) to decrease anxiety and hesitation towards the
  practice, as well as negative effects associated with power imbalance and
  politics between peers.
:::

The following are specific recommendations that I believe could improve the
practices currently implemented in parts of the University of Liverpool.
**My goal with these is to offer critical feedback and areas of improvement**
informed by the current literature on peer-observation.

:::{admonition} School of Environmental Sciences
:class: note

* Continue with the emphasis on self-development instead of evaluation.
* Shift the focus towards the development of the observer, which will also
  serve as an on-boarding tool for new teaching staff.
* Encourage peer-to-peer observation across the School disciplines to foster
  collegiality and avoid focusing solely on the content of the module.
* Include as part of the training at least one observation by an expert
  educator with experience in reflective practice.
:::

:::{admonition} PGCAP
:class: note

* Continue allowing participants to self-assign peers for the observations.
* Strongly encourage or require being an observer for another participant.
* Include as part of the training at least one observation by an expert
  educator with experience in reflective practice.
* Include the observation by the participant of one experienced educator in the
  participants own domain, ideally someone who has been through the PGCAP
  program.
* Remove aspects of the observation form that are related purely to the
  judgement of the quality of teaching practice by the observer. Replace them
  with more open-ended areas of improvement (when conducted by an expert
  educator) or reflections on self-improvement (when conducted by the
  participant).
