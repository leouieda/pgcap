## Introduction

Peer-observation of teaching is a practice in which one or more staff observe
the teaching of another and provide feedback for reflection and discussion.
The practice of peer-observation can vary both in format and in overall goals
{cite:p}`Cosh1998`.
However, it is still widely used as a form of
professional development for teaching staff both within and, more recently,
across different higher education institutions {cite:p}`OKeeffe2021`.

There are a large number of studies looking into different models of
peer-observation, the effectiveness of their implementation strategies in
various contexts, and the challenges faced during implementation
(see {cite:t}`Fletcher2018` for an overview).
While enlightening, this abundance can make it challenging for individuals who
desire to adopt peer-observation within their institutions to figure out which
model to use and how to best conduct the practice.

This review is my attempt to synthesise some of the best practices found in the
teaching and learning literature around peer-observation in a higher education
setting.
I will offer an overview of the most common models, the evidence in favour or
against them, and the key recommendations distilled from them.
My hope is that this investigation will inform the current practice of
peer-observation within the {term}`PGCAP` program and the recent adoption
within the School of Environmental Sciences of the University of Liverpool, UK.


## Implementation of peer observation in higher education

Modes of implementation and how they differ.

Advantages and disadvantages of each.

What has been tried before and findings about each mode.

## Reflection: Peer-observation in the School of Environmental Sciences

Analysis of how our current implementation relates to the modes and results
presented earlier.


## Reflection: Peer-observation in the PGCAP

Analysis of how our current implementation relates to the modes and results
presented earlier.

Possible problems and solutions.


## Summary

Summarise why I'm doing this, how it's done in Liverpool, pros and cons.


## Recommendations for changes to current practice

Given what I've learned:

* What works in current practice given literature
* What could be changed to be more reflective of literature recommendations
