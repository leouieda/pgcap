## Introduction

**Peer-observation of teaching** is a practice in which one or more staff
observe the teaching of another and provide feedback for reflection and
discussion. The practice of peer-observation can vary both in format and in
overall goals {cite:p}`Cosh1998`.
However, it is still widely used as a form of
professional development for teaching staff both within and, more recently,
across different higher education institutions {cite:p}`OKeeffe2021`.

There are a large number of studies looking into different models of
peer-observation, the effectiveness of their implementation strategies in
various contexts, and the challenges faced during implementation
(see {cite:t}`Fletcher2018` for an overview).
While enlightening, this abundance can make it challenging for individuals who
desire to adopt peer-observation within their institutions to figure out which
model to use and how to best conduct the practice.

This review is my attempt to synthesise some of the best practices found in the
teaching and learning literature around peer-observation in a higher education
setting.
I will offer an overview of the most common models, the evidence in favour or
against them, and the key recommendations distilled from them.
My hope is that this investigation will inform the current practice of
peer-observation within the {term}`PGCAP` program and the recent adoption
within the School of Environmental Sciences of the University of Liverpool, UK.


## The purposes of peer observation

The purpose of the peer-observation exercise is subjective and there doesn't
appear to be a consensus in the literature.
As pointed out by {cite:t}`Cosh1998`, "There is, however, some confusion or
uncertainty over whether the purpose of this is development or accountability,
and consequently over the role of the observer."
Nonetheless, {cite:t}`HammersleyFletcher2004` identified three broadly defined
purposes of peer-observation among practitioners:

:::{glossary}
Accountability
    Evaluation of the teacher.

Personal reflection
    Observation elicits reflection on the pedagogical practices by both
    observer and observed.

Dissemination of best practice
    Observers learn and share best-practices observed with peers.
:::

The emphasis placed on each of these different purposes varies with the
particular model of peer-observation being used.
There is also debate on whether reflection is done effectively in practice, or
is even achieved at all, depending on circumstances
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2005`.

The one thing that is recurrent in the literature is that a peer-observation
should **not** be done solely for {term}`accountability` purposes
{cite:p}`Cosh1998,Fletcher2018,HammersleyFletcher2004,HammersleyFletcher2005`.
Doing so undermines team building, leads to disengagement of staff, and can
prompt defensive behaviour towards critique.


## Models of peer observation

Most recent studies tend to focus on one of three models of peer-observation
{cite:p}`Gosling2002`:
{term}`evaluation`, {term}`developmental`, and {term}`collaborative`.
However, {cite:t}`Cosh1998` proposed the {term}`reflective` model as an
alternative which has characteristics often reflecting the conclusions of
studies into the other three models, even when not named specifically (e.g.,
{cite:t}`HammersleyFletcher2004,Yiend2012,Fletcher2018`).

:::{glossary}
Evaluation
    Administrative or other senior staff observe with the goal to monitor
    teaching quality and pass judgement on the teaching of the observed
    (i.e., purely for {term}`accountability`).

Developmental
    An educational expert is the observer and focuses on providing critical
    feedback on the teaching practice instead of the module content directly.
    The expert also facilitates reflective practice of the observed and serves
    as a model for effective feedback.

Collaborative
    A peer (teaching staff) serves as the observer. Generally regarded as more
    collegial where peers observe and focus on formative feedback to improve
    teaching. Peers can be from within or without the subject matter being
    taught.

Reflective
    Like the collaborative model, a peer serves as the observer. However, the
    focus is shifted from the observed to the observer, who is instead
    performing a reflective analysis of their own teaching in light of the
    observation.
:::

The evidence seems to be in favour of using a combination of the
{term}`developmental` and {term}`collaborative` models (e.g.
{cite:t}`Atkinson2010` and {cite:t}`Yiend2012`).
Some of the reasons **against a solely peer-to-peer observation** include:

* "Many staff are ill-equipped, without further training, to evaluate and
  provide feedback on the effectiveness of others’ teaching" -- {cite:p}`Gosling2009`.
* Reflective practice is difficult and is a skill that needs to be taught and
  demonstrated in order to be used effectively {cite:p}`Aronson2010`.
* Peers are often reluctant to provide even constructive criticism and tend to
  focus solely on the good aspects of a colleague's teaching
  {cite:p}`Shortland2010`. This is likely exacerbated by power imbalance
  between the observer and observed and office politics.

In these instances, a first observation is performed by an educational expert
and then followed by a peer-observation.
{cite:t}`Yiend2012` found that the amount of critical feedback and reflective
practice of the observed increased when they were first exposed to an expert
educator.
{cite:t}`Lygo-Baker2007` also concludes that the participation of a
developmental observer is important for facilitating reflective practice.

## Challenges

Implementation of a blended developmental-collaborative model are not without
challenges, not least of which is the negative perception of the practice from
staff:

:::{epigraph}
The common perceptions encountered, and which required consultation, included:

1. Effective peer review is too time consuming and involves knowledge and
   skills we as a faculty do not have.
1. Personal or professional rivalries will contaminate the process and create
   deep divisions or recourse to legal remedies.
1. Peer review violates the norms of privacy and egalitarianism in teaching.

-- {cite:t}`Fletcher2018`
:::

Possible solutions to combat these negative perceptions include:

* Allowing staff to opt-in to both observing and being observed
  {cite:p}`Fletcher2018`. This can help lower tensions between teaching staff
  and administration.
* Reports must be confidential between the observer and observed. Peers will
  only discuss difficult issues when they know that the conversations will not
  be shared, and thus negatively impact their career progression
  {cite:p}`Hicks1999,Brinko1993`.

Additionally, it would be useful to highlight the many benefits of observation
for the **observer** that have been reported:

* A {term}`collaborative` approach contributes to the cohesion of the
  institution and provides a starting point for cross-disciplinary discussion
  {cite:p}`Whipp2017`.
* Observers are better able to reflect on their own practice
  {cite:p}`Sullivan2012`.
* Learning new strategies and styles which can be adopted in their teaching
  {cite:p}`Hendry2012`.
* When peers are from the same discipline, discern differences in the content
  delivered by the observed and their own {cite:p}`Tenenberg2014`.

:::{admonition} Proposal
:class: tip

To me, all of these are strong arguments in favour of a **different blended
model**:

1. First a {term}`developmental` observation with the purpose of modelling good
   reflective practice and feedback.
1. Followed by a {term}`reflective` observation with the previous observed now
   serving as observer and focusing on their self-development from the
   observation.

## Practical implementation


From Cosh:

Implementation:

    Must be formalized: “It is essential that the procedure should be formalized in some way to ensure that it does not die through inertia and the pressures of workload.”

    People can still feel judged. “The participants should, therefore, be reassured and consulted, and decide jointly on such factors as who should be observed, how often, what protocol should be followed, what the focus should be, and what form feedback should take”

    Feedback is key. “in order for insights to be clarified and for good practice to be shared and disseminated.”

    Format: Seminars, workshops, discussions, forms. “as along as the emphasis is always on what the observer has learnt or decided to think about.”

Sample observation form asks:

    Lessons learned from observing

    Further action planned by observer

    Topics that may be of broader interest


"Most follow a design which involves a pre-
observation meeting, the actual observation and a post-observation session"
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`

. It is important that PoT does not
stagnate by becoming repetitive

Staff are often concerned with receiving negative feedback
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`

"Thus, it is possible that if less experienced staff acted as observers of more
experienced staff they would gain considerably from seeing good practice in
operation"
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`
