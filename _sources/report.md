## Introduction

Define peer observation.

Why I'm doing this review.

Looking to inform practice at the School of Environmental Sciences of the
University of Liverpool.

Also practices during the PGCAP peer observation patches.


## Implementation of peer observation in higher education

Modes of implementation and how they differ.

Advantages and disadvantages of each.

What has been tried before and findings about each mode.

## Reflection: Peer-observation in the School of Environmental Sciences

Analysis of how our current implementation relates to the modes and results
presented earlier.


## Reflection: Peer-observation in the PGCAP

Analysis of how our current implementation relates to the modes and results
presented earlier.

Possible problems and solutions.


## Summary

Summarise why I'm doing this, how it's done in Liverpool, pros and cons.


## Recommendations for changes to current practice

Given what I've learned:

* What works in current practice given literature
* What could be changed to be more reflective of literature recommendations
