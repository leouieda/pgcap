## Introduction

**Peer-observation of teaching** is a practice in which one or more staff
observe the teaching of another and provide feedback for reflection and
discussion. The practice of peer-observation can vary both in format and in
overall goals {cite:p}`Cosh1998`.
However, it is still widely used as a form of
professional development for teaching staff both within and, more recently,
across different higher education institutions {cite:p}`OKeeffe2021`.

There are a large number of studies looking into different models of
peer-observation, the effectiveness of their implementation strategies in
various contexts, and the challenges faced during implementation
(see {cite:t}`Fletcher2018` for an overview).
While enlightening, this abundance can make it challenging for individuals who
desire to adopt peer-observation within their institutions to figure out which
model to use and how to best conduct the practice.

This review is my attempt to synthesise some of the best practices found in the
teaching and learning literature around peer-observation in a higher education
setting.
I will offer an overview of the most common models, the evidence in favour or
against them, and the key recommendations distilled from them.
My hope is that this investigation will inform the current practice of
peer-observation within the {term}`PGCAP` program and the recent adoption
within the School of Environmental Sciences of the University of Liverpool, UK.


## The different purposes and models of peer observation

{cite:t}`HammersleyFletcher2004` identified three broadly defined purposes of
peer-observation among practitioners:

:::{glossary}
Accountability
    Evaluation of the teacher.

Personal reflection
    Observation elicits reflection on the pedagogical practices by both
    observer and observed.

Dissemination of best practice
    Observers learn and share best-practices observed with peers.
:::

The emphasis placed on each of these different purposes varies with the
particular model of peer-observation being used.
There is also debate on whether reflection is done effectively in practice or
is even achieved at all depending on circumstances
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2005`.

Most recent studies tend to focus on one of three models of peer-observation
{cite:p}`Gosling2002`:
{term}`evaluation`, {term}`developmental`, and {term}`collaborative`.
However, {cite:t}`Cosh1998` proposed an alternative {term}`reflective` model
which has characteristics often reflecting the conclusions of studies into the
other three models, even when not named specifically (e.g.,
{cite:t}`HammersleyFletcher2004,Yiend2012,Fletcher2018`).

:::{glossary}
Evaluation
    Administrative or other senior staff observe with the goal to monitor
    teaching quality and pass judgement on the teaching of the observed
    (i.e., purely for {term}`accountability`).

Developmental
    Educational expert observes and focuses on reflection of what makes good teaching.

Collaborative
    More collegial where peers observe and focus on formative feedback to improve teaching.

Reflective
    By {cite:p}`Cosh1998`.

## Practical implementation

"Most follow a design which involves a pre-
observation meeting, the actual observation and a post-observation session"
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`

. It is important that PoT does not
stagnate by becoming repetitive

Staff are often concerned with receiving negative feedback
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`

"Thus, it is possible that if less experienced staff acted as observers of more
experienced staff they would gain considerably from seeing good practice in
operation"
{cite:p}`HammersleyFletcher2004`

## Summary

Summarise why I'm doing this, how it's done in Liverpool, pros and cons.


## Recommendations for changes to current practice

Given what I've learned:

* What works in current practice given literature
* What could be changed to be more reflective of literature recommendations
