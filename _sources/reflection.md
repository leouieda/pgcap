# Project aims and strategy

```{note}
This is the first assessment of the ADEV701 module. The assignment is to create
a vlog about my proposed research project to introduce my aims and methods and
to get early feedback from the instructor and my peers.
```

## Assignment

Content:

* Identification of appropriate focus for and approach to the investigation contextualised within the HE environment and supported by relevant theory and policy.
* Explanation of how you will conduct your investigation.
* Discussion of a suitable dissemination strategy.
* Justification of your investigative strategy.

Create a 15 minute vlog in which you effectively communicate the following to peers:

* Reflect on your academic practice in the light of University policy and strategy and the UKPSF to identify an area of strategic importance to the University which is relevant to you and your role in learning and teaching in higher education.
* Plan how you will investigate this aspect of your academic practice to enhance learning teaching and the student experience: identify an appropriate educational research question and methodology, address ethical considerations and develop a plan to achieve this.
* Explain how you will disseminate your findings: identify a relevant journal or other dissemination strategy, note the submission/dissemination guidelines and plan how you will achieve this.
* Justify your investigative strategy.

## Notes

* Idea: Investigate the current state of CPD using Peer observation. 
* Literature review of the past 10-20 years (not systematic).
* Also look at "Japanese teaching training" and its application to HE.
* Disseminate: 
  * [Journal of Geoscience Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ujge20/current) as commentary or review.
  * Preprint (find a server for education)
  * Blog and circulate to the [NAGT](https://nagt.org/) and other mailing lists.
