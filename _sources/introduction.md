# Introduction

This portfolio contains reflections on my experience diving deeper into the
literature of teaching and learning through the ADEV700 module at the
University of Liverpool.
It's a collection of different "patches", links to relevant literature, and
concepts learned before and during the module.

Compiling this portfolio was an interesting experience.
I often do reflections on my practice and career but never in such a
structured manner.
And I certainly don't write things down as much as I should,
which often leads to me not being able to find the references I want or
not having a good way to refer to these ideas when communicating with others.
Plus, this was a great chance to play around with
[JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/), which I intend to use for all my
teaching material as soon as I can find some time.

## About me

Since 2019, I have been working at the University of Liverpool as a Lecturer in
Geophysics. I teach several different subjects, including computer programming,
remote sensing, gravimetry, and geodynamics.
Before coming to Liverpool, I spent 2.5 years as a postdoctoral fellow at the
University of Hawai'i at Manoa. Before that, I worked as Assistant Professor at
the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro for 3 years.

I spend a large part of my time working on several open-source software
projects.
My approach to science is "open by default" and I make virtually everything I
do publicly available under permissive open licences.
