# Introduction

This portfolio contains reflections on my experience diving deeper into the
literature of teaching and learning through the ADEV700 module at the
University of Liverpool.
It's a collection of different "patches", links to relevant literature, and
concepts learned before and during the module.

Compiling this portfolio was an interesting experience.
I often do reflections on my practice and career but never in such a
structured manner.
And I certainly don't write things down as much as I should,
which often leads to me not being able to find the references I want or
not having a good way to refer to these ideas when communicating with others.
Plus, this was a great chance to play around with
[JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/), which I intend to use for all my
teaching material as soon as I can find some time.
