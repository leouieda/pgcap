So far in my career as a lecturer I have gained practical experience designing
and delivering a range of subjects using a variety of formats
(lectures, videos, lab-based, computer-based, field) [A1,A2,K1,K2,K4].
My journey through the teaching and learning literature, however, is relatively
recent.
Throughout this course, I have had the chance to read about current
methodologies and best practices related to my discipline and how these are
backed by pedagogical theory [V3,K3,K2,A5].
My teaching currently reflects some of these practices to varying degrees.
Particular areas of improvement where I see gap between what I should be doing
and what I have implemented so far are:

**Design lessons around peer-instruction**
{cite}`vickrey2015peerinstruction`: I currently make use of some strategies
during practicals (think-pair-share, etc.) but this type of activity could be
more widely used throughout synchronous and asynchronous delivery. An example
would be asynchronous student-led discussion on a forum about a topic covered
in a recorded lecture. For synchronous delivery, I need to allocate more time
for these activities, as was identified during my {ref}`teaching observations
<observations>` [A4,K3,K6,V3].

**More frequent use of formative assessments**
{cite}`wilson2019effectivelesson`: Ideally, each lessons should be designed
from the start around a well-designed set of formative assessments. Currently,
my use of quizzes and quick forms of feedback is sporadic and not as structured
as I would like [V3,K5,K3,K2].

These are my {term}`SMART action plan`s for continuing to improve on these
aspects and develop my skills as an instructor.

**Peer-instruction**:
Reduce the amount of content in live practical sessions to allow
more time for peer discussion activities.
Live sessions are between 2 and 3 hours. Currently, only
around 20% of the time is left for discussion. This should be increased to
40% (or ideally 50%).
This will require relatively small adjustments to the current content and
moving part of practicals that are currently delivered synchronously to
asynchronous (e.g., assign a follow-up formative assessment based on the more
advanced content in a practical).
Since these changes are relatively small, they could be implemented for the
upcoming semester 2 of the 2021/22 academic year.

**Formative assessments**:
Create short quizzes (multiple-choice, true or false, etc.) that can be used
assess students' mental models of the content. As a first step, my goal is to
develop set of multiple-choice questions for my introduction to programming
class (a 4-week long tutorial session for first year students). This will
require breaking down the content I currently deliver into 10-15 minute
sections and designing a quiz for each section. The main challenge will be
coming up with wrong answers that have diagnostic power, allowing me to
specifically address misconceptions and incorrect mental models.
As a more labour intensive action, this will not be implemented in a single
academic year. Instead, I will break it down into manageable steps.
For semester 2 of 2021/22, my goal is to include one quiz per taught session
(four total). These can serve as a foundation that can be expanded in later
years.

The activity where I'm most likely to struggle is the design of formative
assessments. To aid in their development, I will look to the literature for
inspiration and evidence-based techniques (e.g. {cite}`rice2017lecturebreaks`
and {cite}`major2015teaching101`). I also hope to rely on my colleagues for
feedback and support through the peer-observation program that is run by the
School of Environmental Sciences [K5,K6,K2,V3,A5].
