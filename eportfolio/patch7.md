# Patch 7: Professional Discussion

```{note}
These are my notes on some of the discussion topics provided. I thought it
would be good to register them here and ellaborate for future reference.

Most of my teaching involves computer programming, either as the main topic or
as a tool to teach something else.
Brown & Wilson (2018) compiled 10 evidence-based techniques that have been
found to improve teaching of programming.
By far the most impactful was the use of live coding.
Student understand and retention was very good.
Feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
A close second is the use of authentic tasks, which is in line with C2021.

The section on remote sensing.
Combines the techniques of Brown & Wilson (2018) and Wilson (2019) with an
authentic assessment.
Students go from little to no programming knowledge to coding complex
independent analysis of satellite images in just 4 weeks.
The reports they produce really astound me, some being at the level of post-
graduate work.
Feedback is incredibly positive from students and moderators.
I have shared tips and practices repeatedly during meetings, chats, and
moderation.

I have used many many things:
* Chalk and blackboard
* Slides
* Digital whiteboard
* Videos
* Homebrew interactive apps
* Coding environments
* Geophysics kit
* Canvas
* All video conferencing: Teams, Zoom, Jitsi, YouTube, Bluebutton
* Chat apps: Teams and Slack

So far what has worked for me:

* Chalk/blackboard + digital whiteboard are great for explaining complex
  concepts slowly but visuals depend too much on drawing ability
* Slides are great for better visuals but easy to cram too much stuff on them
* Videos are great for students to have material to refer back to but need to
  be short and can be incredibly boring for students. Also easy to overdo.
* Coding environments are great to empower students to explore and reason about
  real applications. Plus it's one of the most desirable transferable skills.
  Needs to be taught carefully and slowly to avoid overwhelming students.

> Describe for us methods for monitoring and evaluating your own teaching

* Asking for direct feedback from students after module sections are done
* Formative assessment: quick polls and questions to determine progress and
  understanding of material
* Peer observation
* External/internal moderation
* EvaSys

Building in frequent formative assessment was hard but really helped adapt as the
modules progressed.
Issues I faced in the first 4 weeks of teaching were addressed in the following
weeks (student performance and feedback/EvaSys confirms this).
Peer observation confirmed that some practices were working well and helped plan
changes to pacing/amount of content for next year.

I offer a variety of delivery modes: short videos, reading assignments, live lectures,
live practicals, Q&A sessions, individual work, group work, lecturing mixed with
think-pair-share activities, etc.
For the coding based practicals in particular, I do live coding and ask students who
can to follow along typing on their computers.
Rubin 2013 suggests that this is the most effective way to teaching intro to coding.
Not all are able to do this so I give them the full code ahead of time and the option
to read instead of type.
Feedback was very positive on both aspects.
I'm also very forgiving of deadlines, absences, and go out of my way to makeadjustments and ensure that students don't get left behind.

I don't think that many of these factors are the most important to consider for
widening participation in HE from underepresented groups.
Institutional racism, lack of opportunity and incentives, and cost are probably
much larger factors.
What I can do in the classroom is encourage and support the students we do have
by providing a positive judgement-free learning environment
and being flexible to those with caring responsibilities, illnesses, etc.

> What impact has C2021 had on your curriculum planning and design and/or
> developing your teaching practices over the module?

To me, the most impactful facet is the push for authentic assessment.
All of the continuous assessment I deliver involves real data and some form of transferable skill:
coding, report writing, visual design, data analysis.
The idea is that the assessment is also an opportunity for the students to explore what their jobs
will be and other skills that may interest them.
My discipline suffers from frequent downturns which can leave many without job prospects.
With this type of assessment they are able to gain experience and transition into other industries if
needed.
Many of my past students and colleagues have done just that.
