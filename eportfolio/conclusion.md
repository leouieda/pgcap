# Conclusion

Throughout this course, I was exposed to the scholarship of teaching and
learning in a deeper way that I ever had before.
The {ref}`bibliography` section contains some of the references I used to base
my current teaching practice and also those that will be foundational for my
development as a lecturer.

All of this happened during trying times brought on by a global pandemic which
led to all teaching being moved online on short notice.
I was lucky to have prior experience with online delivery and an interest in
video/audio production and web design, all of which made my own transition a
lot smoother than those of some less fortunate colleagues.

This portfolio provided the focus I needed to critically reflect on my past,
current, and future practices.
It was also a way to hone some of my skills with video editing (see
{ref}`teaching_philosophy`) and open-access educational content (this website).
I plan to use these technologies going forward, regardless of whether my
teaching will remain online only, go back to fully in person, or a mix of both.
