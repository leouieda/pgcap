## Gap analysis

So far in my career as a lecturer I have gained practical experience designing
and delivering a range of subjects using a variety of formats
(lectures, videos, lab-based, computer-based, field) [A1,A2,K1,K2,K4].
My journey through the teaching and learning literature, however, is relatively
recent.
Throughout this course, I have had the chance to read about current
methodologies and best practices related to my discipline and how these are
backed by pedagogical theory [V3,K3,K2,A5].
My teaching currently reflects some of these practices to varying degrees.
Particular areas of improvement where I see gap between what I should be doing
and what I have implemented so far are:

**Design lessons around peer-instruction**
{cite}`vickrey2015peerinstruction`: I currently make use of some strategies
during practicals (think-pair-share, etc.) but this type of activity could be
more widely used throughout synchronous and asynchronous delivery. An example
would be asynchronous student-led discussion on a forum about a topic covered
in a recorded lecture. For synchronous delivery, I need to allocate more time
for these activities, as was identified during my
{ref}`teaching observations <observations>` [A4,K3,K6,V3].

**More frequent use of formative assessments**
{cite}`wilson2019effectivelesson`: Ideally, each lessons should be designed
from the start around a well-designed set of formative assessments. Currently,
my use of quizzes and quick forms of feedback is sporadic and not as structured
as I would like [V3,K5,K3,K2].

## Short-term ction items

These are my {term}`SMART action plan`s for bridging these gaps in the near
future.

**Peer-instruction**:
Reduce the amount of content in live practical sessions to allow
more time for peer discussion activities.
Live sessions are between 2 and 3 hours. Currently, only
around 20% of the time is left for discussion. This should be increased to
40% (or ideally 50%).
This will require relatively small adjustments to the current content and
moving part of practicals that are currently delivered synchronously to
asynchronous (e.g., assign a follow-up formative assessment based on the more
advanced content in a practical).
Since these changes are relatively small, they could be implemented for the
upcoming semester 2 of the 2021/22 academic year.

**Formative assessments**:
Create short quizzes (multiple-choice, true or false, etc.) that can be used
assess students' mental models of the content. As a first step, my goal is to
develop set of multiple-choice questions for my introduction to programming
class (a 4-week long tutorial session for first year students). This will
require breaking down the content I currently deliver into 10-15 minute
sections and designing a quiz for each section. The main challenge will be
coming up with wrong answers that have diagnostic power, allowing me to
specifically address misconceptions and incorrect mental models.
As a more labour intensive action, this will not be implemented in a single
academic year. Instead, I will break it down into manageable steps.
For semester 2 of 2021/22, my goal is to include one quiz per taught session
(four total). These can serve as a foundation that can be expanded in later
years.
This is the activity where I'm most likely to struggle.
To aid in their development, I will look to the literature for inspiration and
evidence-based techniques (e.g. {cite}`rice2017lecturebreaks` and
{cite}`major2015teaching101`).

## Further development

Over the last year, I have learned much from this module and the reading that
was prompted by the writing of these reflections.
Though much of the module content itself is theoretical and not
immediately applicable without significant investment of time and effort,
the discussions and topic awareness that stemmed from them prompted me to
search the pedagogical literature for practical advice more directly related to
my own field-specific needs.
This knowledge has been crucial to identifying the gaps mentioned above and
the action plans for closing them.

Because of obvious reasons, I have not attended any other type of formal
training and development over the past year.
I am hopeful that this will change in the future because multiple factors
like the gradual easing of restrictions, having more time due to accumulated
experience and teaching material, and attaining confirmation in my post
(a significant source of anxiety and current demand of my time).

In the near future, I plan to engage more with peer observation within the
School of Environmental Sciences [K5,K6,K2,V3,A5].
I have already completed the required training and would like to serve as
an observer in other modules across the School.
The Department of Geography and Planning has modules with content related to my
own discipline delivered by renowned instructors.
This is the activity from which I personally gained the most during ADEV700.
I feel that serving as an observer and being observed yearly will be the most
efficient way to continue my professional development, especially in these
first few years of my appointment.

Over time, I would also like to evolve the peer observation within the
School to a form of *lesson study*, a practice widely used in Japan where
teachers come together to plan lessons, observe their outcomes, and then hold
a post-lesson discussion.
This practice has been found to be one of the most effective forms of teacher
professional development {cite}`doig_groves2011lessonstudy`.
There will be challenges implementing this in the UK higher education setting
{cite}`toshiakira2014lessonstudymisconceptions`.
If a core group of interested lecturers can be found, I believe that it would
be a worthwhile goal.
As a starting point, it would be interesting to do a thorough review of the
literature around this practice as my portfolio contribution for the upcoming
ADEV701 module.
