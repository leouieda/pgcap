# Patch 4: Pivotal Learning Moment II

When I first started teaching in 2014, I was thrown into a classroom with no
preparation or formal training in pedagogy.
I had to simultaneously teach myself how to teach as well as the
subject, which was outside of my expertise.
After a rough start, I sought out training and found the
{term}`Software Carpentry` Instructor Training program (A5).
The 2-day online training session was a crash course in the theory of teaching
and learning, which introduced several concepts that were new to me and
provided validation and terminology for some of the things I was already
implementing.
A summary of the concepts covered in the program can be found in
{cite}`wilson2019effectivelesson` and {cite}`brown2018coding`.

I found particularly effective the use of peer-instruction to balance skill
levels and provide 1-on-1 help {cite}`vickrey2015peerinstruction` (A4).
My lessons continue to be planned with this in mind and all practical
activities now include a think-pair-share type activity.
This type of activity is very effective for teaching computer programming,
a subject that is considered difficult and even scary by many students.
What is more, their background in computing can vary drastically depending
on their schooling, with some students having mastered the basic concepts and
others never having had any prior exposure to the topic.
Research from the field of Computer Science also indicates that allowing
students to articulate what they have learned to their peers can also help
with the retention of women in their degree programs
{cite}`barker2005csfinearts`.

Most of my teaching involves some form of programming, whether as the main
subject or as a tool in practical activities.
While programming is one of the most important transferable skills that
students in STEM can gain, many come to dread modules that require it.
The use of live-coding during instruction is probably one of the most important
things any instructor can do to alleviate this problem
{cite}`rubin2013livecoding` (A1-2).
Having to type out all code along with saying out loud all that is being
written helps reduce the pace of the instructor and provides both visual and
auditory stimulus to students.
There is also the bonus effect of instructors committing sporadic mistakes in
their code, which provide an opportunity to teach students how to identify and
fix similar errors.

On top of the pedagogic theory, I was exposed to a well designed virtual
learning experience back in 2017.
The program was run remotely through Zoom with instructors and learnings spread
out across different time zones.
The instructors used break-out rooms for frequent think-pair-share activities,
which kept us engaged through the long sessions.
They also scheduled frequent breaks (10 minutes for every hour of instruction)
and encouraged participants to stand up and walk away from the computer screen.
Instructors and participants had access to a shared online document in which we
typed answers to questions, collected notes collaboratively, and curated
questions for the instructors.
This technique is difficult to replicate on an in person session and provides
students with a valuable reference and awareness of each other's thoughts in an
anonymous medium.
Having students collaboratively write the answers to questions and group
assignments in the shared document allows me to go over their responses and
comment on each to highlight positive aspects and provide feedback on ways to
improve (A3).

Having this prior experience with a very effective online delivery meant that I
was well prepared for the shift online caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The use of break-out rooms for paired activities, frequent breaks, option for
text based interactions, and keeping a shared document for students were all
things I picked up from this course.
They have been extremely valuable to my teaching this past year and were very
well received by students.
