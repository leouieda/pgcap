Learn about {term}`authentic assessment` (A5).

Changed how I view summative assessment.

In hind sight, these were the assessments I like the most as a student.

Several have been useful in my own professional life.

Tie to transferable skills like coding for better job market (V4)

Use of Python and real data works well for my subject.

Students leave with skills and a portfolio of authentic work.
