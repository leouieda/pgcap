A3 Assessment

Learn about {term}`authentic assessment` (A5).

Changed how I view summative assessment.

In hind sight, these were the assessments I like the most as a student.

Several have been useful in my own professional life.

Tie to transferable skills like coding for better job market (V4)

How this was perceived by external moderators (K6?)

Use of Python and real data works well for my subject.

Students leave with skills and a portfolio of authentic work.



Assessment has always been an aspect of education with which I've struggled.
As a student, assessments often bore me and seem like needless hurdles that we
are required to jump through to progress to more interesting topics.
This perception was stronger when assessments were disconnected from the actual
practice of the subject at hand, lacked intellectual challenge, or were
unnecessarily convoluted.
On the other hand, assessments that were challenging and provided an
opportunity to sharpen useful skills were usually the ones at which I performed
best.
As an educator, I initially did not poses enough self-awareness to realize that
my assessments were not much better than the ones I myself disliked.
I knew something about them was not ideal but could not identify what.

After gaining some experience and arriving at Liverpool, I came across the term
{term}`authentic assessment` while reading the University's
{term}`Curriculum 2021`.
Around the same time, I inherited an assessment for my remote sensing module
that asked students to choose their own research topic and apply all skills
learned in the module to solve a real-world problem.
Though I was initially sceptical of this format, students performed very
well and their feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
In hindsight, this should not have been surprising since this type of authentic
assessment gives learners agency over their education and directly exercises
useful transferable skills, both of which are key motivators for adult learners
{cite}`wlodkowski2017enhancing`.
