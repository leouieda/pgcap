# My teaching philosophy

```{note}
This is *Patch 2*, submitted on XXX.

It's a digital story telling activity about my teaching philosophy.
```

## Things to consider

Who am I?

* Current role
* Relevant previous roles
* My qualifications
* Ties to research

Teaching philosophy:

* About my personal values and beliefs of teaching, learning, and assessment.
* Provide examples of what I do in session that support these
* My vision as an educator
* Underpinned by theory (i.e., citations + box ticking)
* How this will develop in the future

Questions to guide:

* Describe my best learning experience as a student
* Describe my best teaching experience
* Why do I teach (why does it matter to me)
* What am I trying to achieve in my students
* Why is this important to me?
* What strategies and approaches I use
* Why do I use one strategy vs another
* What literature changed my views or way I teach

Student and peer feedback:

* Is it important to me?
* How do I collect it?
* What have I learned from it?

Other:

* 3-5 minutes
* Narrative 1st person
* Use specific examples about me
* How I see the student/teacher relationship
* What I expect from students

Supposed to be a nice story video but I have to make it super boring by forcing
mentions to UKPSF and literature. Maybe put it all at the end or in a
transcript to make it less tedious.

## Ideas

* Write a script first that is about 3-5 minutes long
* Do a story board to match script and visuals
* Include visuals later to accompany the voice over
* Record video of me reading the script so I can use the footage if required
* Use some of the animations from my recent talks (Google Earth, notebook use,
  etc)

## Draft script
