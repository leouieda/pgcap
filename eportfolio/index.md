# PGCAP Patchwork ePortfolio

This is my patchwork ePortfolio that will be submitted as the final assessment
of the ADEV700 2020/21 and ADEV701 2021/22 modules (PGCAP).

The following are my assessment submissions, reflections, and notes.
I also include a list of relevant references that I have found useful for my
teaching (mainly geosciences and computer programming).
