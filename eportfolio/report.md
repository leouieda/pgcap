# A review of peer-observation in higher education

This task sits within the context of your academic practice at the University
of Liverpool and is subject to the constraints of what can be achieved within a
20 credit Level 7 module. You are expected to draw on your knowledge and
understanding of the scholarship and practice of learning and teaching in
higher education, informed by your successful completion of ADEV700 or ADEV710,
and follow through with the planned investigation identified in your
Vlog/poster assessment. The final report enables you to disseminate the
findings of your investigation in a format that meets the assessment
requirements and may also enable you to disseminate your findings more widely.
