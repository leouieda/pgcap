# Project aims and strategy

## Aims

This project aims to:

1. Revise the existing scholarship of teaching and learning around
   peer-observation of teaching, particularly when applied to a
   higher-education context.
1. Gain evidence-based insights into the existing best practices for
   implementing peer-observation as a professional development tool as opposed
   to a quality assurance tool.
1. Reflect on the current implementations of peer-observation within the School
   of Environmental Sciences and the PGCAP program of the University of
   Liverpool in light of the insights gained.
1. Highlight examples of good practice in the above-mentioned implementations
   and make informed recommendations for areas of improvement.

## Investigation strategy

The investigation will be conducted through non-systematic literature review
and reflection.
Relevant studies will be sourced through scholarly search engines and existing
citations within the discovered literature.
Special attention will be paid to more recent studies, particularly those
taking online education environments into account.
A systematic review would have been ideal but given the time constraints and
scope of this project within the ADVE710 module workload, the chose approach
was found to be more suitable.
