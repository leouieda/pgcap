## About me

Hi there!
I'm Leonardo Uieda and I have been working at the University of
Liverpool as a Lecturer in Geophysics since mid 2019.
I teach several different subjects, including computer programming, remote
sensing, gravimetry, and geodynamics.
Before coming to Liverpool, I spent 2.5 years as a postdoctoral fellow at the
University of Hawai'i at Manoa.
Before that, I worked as Assistant Professor at the Universidade do Estado do
Rio de Janeiro for 3 years.

I spend a large part of my time working on several open-source software
projects.
My approach to science is "open by default" and I make virtually everything I
do publicly available under permissive open licences.
